        <a href=https://ghiblicollection.com>Studio Ghibli Collection</a>
        <p>1) Hayao Miyazaki is a Japanese animator, filmmaker, and manga artist who is the founder of the well-known studio Ghibli who have made highly acclaimed feature films such as Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, etc.</p>
        <p>These are films that I have seen while growing up and have affected how I see certain aspects in cinema such as animation quality, visual storytelling, camera work, and more in regard to how to construct great cinema.</p>
        <p>Even if you are bored by their stories, I would argue that they still have very organic and subtle ways to show storytelling which have inspired many other creators to closely follow what they did in production, music, and storytelling.</p>
        <p>I have to give credit to the whole studio though as Miyazaki could not do everything, they did by himself. This studio is one of the first I think of to recall great animation, so I take a quite a bit of philosophies from them.</p>
        <p>I could also list a few other anime studios as there are so many with their own style and also offer high quality productions.</p>

        <h2><em>-Nujabes-</em></h2>
        <br>

        <a href=https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Rq3YOF9YG9YfCWD4D56RZ>Nujabes On Spotify</a>
        <p>2) Seba Jun, or better known as Nujabes, is considered the pioneer of lo-fi hip hop genre of music, a genre which at this point is so fast in the number of tracks it contains.</p>
        <p>This is, in my opinion, a big deal for myself and for others since it is a genre tons and tons of people listen to but do not know the history and origins of.</p>
        <p>Since I am a student for the majority of my life, I give huge credit to him since lo-fi is a genre I've listened to a lot since it is known to be calm background music.</p>
        <p>His tracks though in comparison to modern day lo-fi definitely feel more "pronounced" and less in the background with the addition of vocals in many tracks as well as very melodic tunes.</p>
        <p>Listening to lo-fi helps me think deeply about ideas or scenarios since they are so chill and come in many different styles.</p>

        <h2><em>-H.R. Giger-</em></h2>
        <br>

        <br>
        <a href=https://www.hrgiger.com/>H.R. Giger Official Website</a>
        <p>H.R. Giger is an artist best known for the alien series and responsible for the alien's iconic design.</p>
        <p>Creating imagery mixing human and machine in a really unique way even today.</p>
        <p>Even if he is not among my absolute favorites but the style is still unique and striking enough for me to mention. (Also chose since Alien series finally being good again with Alien:Romulus)</p>
        <p>If I am seeking a VERY specific type of design this is probably my go too for this specific vibe of sci-fi.</p>
